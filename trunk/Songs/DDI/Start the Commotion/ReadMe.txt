DJ Drafthorse had shortened this long ago and put it up for DL for anybody
that wanted to make steps to it. I DLed it along with many other songs,
and left it on my hard drive to be forgotten for about 4 months. I
rediscover it all of a sudden and say to myself "Hey I have to put this in
DWI!" and so I did. It's fun on all three difficulties and just an itsy
bitsy teeny weeny little bit tricky on Maniac. That's all, thank you.

Special thanks to:

Jon Effertz for making me the banner and background without having to give
him my DWI. :)
