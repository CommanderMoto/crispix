Introduction:

What can I say here?  I guess that even though I always have a difficult time choosing a song for competitions, this one just kind of jumped out at me right away, though it was not very blatant.  I originally planned on entering "Usmiechnij Sie" by Long & Junior, but that fizzled out and died so quickly that I was left going....WTF?  After that, I decided on an older classic, "Beautiful Man" by Radiorama.  This actually lasted even less time than Usmiechnij Sie, but it at least got some attention as I attempted to cut it.  Finally, I had to choose between two seperate files.  One, this one, ended up getting chosen, cause even though I sure love entering stupid easy files into hardcore simfile tournaments, I still feel that it was the better of the two in the long run.

Anyways, I have no expectation to even make it through the first round, but it's always worth a shot, especially with this piece of mierda.  I know that even if it fails horribly right away, someone will appreciate it, and that is truly what counts. The graphics are not what I had hoped for, every one of my graphics people just disappeared and left me completely screwed, so I had to go for my backup plan, and that never works out right.

That all being said, I included the following as extras, in an attempt to extract as many additional "bonus" points from people as possible:
1: Double Steps
2: Additional Graphics (See "Extras" Folder)
3: Lyric File (Jesus, how am I supposed to make lyrics for the "Here we go" parts?! *grumbles*)
4: CD Title

Outroduction:

Ok, so I lied, this song is just terrible.  If it makes it past round one, well, everyone who voted for it deserves to just be shot in the face with several differnt weapons, not to mention they should take it all without any pain killers.  And I'm talking about inflicting just as much pain as humanly possible here, just to be fair about it.  I put effort into this, and no one should give it credit just for that.
Anywho, chances are that I won't play this song, or this chart again until a month or so AFTER this competition, even to compare it to others, just because I hate it just that much right now.  I am a bad human being, and death is the only option for me.  That being said, I'm may go off myself right now, so you'll know who stepped it by reading the bemani obituaries or something.
From beginning to end, this file has been WAY more trouble than it's worth.  Bad sync, graphics barely making it in time, and life-based distractions all occured, but hopefully it'll be worth it to someone.  PEACE!

You judges better read this thing, for christs sake!
