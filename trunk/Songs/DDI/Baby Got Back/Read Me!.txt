 You've probably all heard the song before... After much soul 
searching, I decided On this song for the Legendary Tournamix 4
(After a strenuous 2 month search) I was all like: 
Yoo! I wanna throw in a buncha uuber 1337 Tempo changes that dont 
go with the song, use tEh wrong BPM to throw People Off 
and Make a 4 Freezes at once to Mess you up if you have a Crappy 
Keyboard!!  But then the drugs wore off.  And this is the result. 
I hope you are enjoy.

 I used Tempo Tapper, X Step, DWI and Stepmania for this dang DWI, 
but it's In sync quite nicely. So it's all worth it.

The Basic Steps can be done by an average newb. Not too hard.  Just 
a few 8th note taps on the same arrow.

Standard steps have a few jumps in there mixed with some little 8th 
note hits.(As most Standard songs have).

The heavy steps definitely doable on feet. A few "Tears" like steps 
here and there.  Couple of 16th note runs, but nothing impossible. 
Almost... alllmost... similar to the oni steps with less 16th note 
runs... But more air, and more freezes.  Try playing with your feet. 
It's quite enjoyable.

 Oni Steps are a lil tougher with a few more 16th Note runs.  I still 
Say they're doable on feet.  This one's more along the difficulty of 
Paranoia Survivor.  A little easier, so I made it a 9'er.  A HARD 9'er.
But I dont think it's worth being a 10... 'er.  
Well... maybe an easy 10... 
You can change the damn difficulty if you want.
