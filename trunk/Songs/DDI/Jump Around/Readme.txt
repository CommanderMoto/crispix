This is my first foray into the wonderful world of DWI creating.  I absolutely
love the soundtrack from Jet Grind Radio, and this song is one of my particular
favorites.  It has a great beat, reminiscent of Spin the Disc.  Some of the
step patterns reflect this similarity.  I strove to make this song playable
not only on fingers, but on feet.  If you have the means, definitely give it
a try on foot!

If you're having trouble with the hectic nature of some of the steps on maniac, 
try putting it on 1.5x or 2x.  This will help you get a feel for the arrows.  
Most of the time they go right with the music!

Song length:  1:26

BASIC:        2 feet,
ANOTHER:      6 feet,
MANIAC:       8 feet,
