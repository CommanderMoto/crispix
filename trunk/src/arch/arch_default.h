/* 
 * The basic design principle of arch is that a new platform can be up and running
 * quickly using only arch_default, with OpenGL graphics and SDL input, and things can
 * be overloaded later.  That way, people don't have to learn how arch works
 * until after they have the basic stuff running.
 *
 * For Xbox, let's leave this file alone, and special case stuff in arch_xbox.h.
 *
 * For LowLevelWindow, just undefine SUPPORT_OPENGL and don't link any LLW at
 * all.

 * For InputHandler, undef SUPPORT_SDL_INPUT and we won't create the SDL input
 * handler.  (We'll still include the header here, but it'll never be used.)

/* We can have any number of input drivers.  By default, use SDL for keyboards

 * header. */
