This stuff is all built manually; just do "nmake foo.exe" for each binary.
It's not worth making a project for each since that'll just triple the number
of files, and they probably won't be updated much, and since they're prereqs
for building the main project, it's not worth the hassle of VC dependencies.
(I'll check in binaries for the actual utils, since they're tiny.) I've modified
verinc to output C++ instead of assembly, so we don't introduce asm deps, and
removed most output, since it's too noisy.

=============================================================================
Verinc
=============================================================================
Verinc takes version.bin, which holds a single four-byte binary build number,
increments it, generates an .asm file with the current build number and date,
and then exits.  That's it.

=============================================================================
Mapconv
=============================================================================
When VirtualDub crashes, it takes a snapshot of the current stack and code
around EIP, and produces a crash dump that I can use to diagnose the cause
of the failure.  Part of this process is producing a disassembly.  IA-32
(x86) is non-trivial to parse, and the current version of VirtualDub
(1.4.10) requires both a table to drive the disassembler and a list of
symbols to guide the disassembly and call stack generation.

Mapconv produces the symbolic debugging tables.  It accepts a map file from
the Visual C++ linker and produces a .vdi file with a segment list and
a table for translating relative virtual addresses (RVAs) to symbols.  It
also prepends a disassembler table to the beginning of the file (see below).
At runtime, VirtualDub uses the segment list to determine which entries on
the stack are likely valid return addresses, and then consults the symbol
table to translate the addresses to symbols.

Run mapconv as follows:
   mapconv virtualdub.map virtualdub.vdi ia32.bin

=============================================================================
Disasm
=============================================================================
Disasm produces the table that drives the 1.4.10+ disassembler.

The table itself is a list of rules, which are sequentially applied against
the code bytes.  When one matches, the rule's result string is expanded to
produce the disassembly for that instruction.  Rules may embed other sets
of rules as part of their pattern; this functionality avoids having to
replicate rules for the mod-reg-mem (modrm) and scale-index-base (sib) bytes.
Full documentation for the pattern matching and result languages is included
in the ia32.txt file.

There are two ways you can run disasm:
    disasm
    disasm <source.txt> <dst.bin>

In the first case, the source is assumed to be 'ia32.txt' and the destination
'ia32.bin'.  Disasm will read the source file and attempt to compile it.  If
the compilation fails, an error will be printed.  Otherwise, disasm will write
out the compiled module, and then attempt to test the module against some of
its own code.  If you have trouble compiling disasm, it may be due to
P4/Athlon instructions in test1(); you can safely delete the offending
instructions from this function as it is never executed.

Once the disassembler module (ia32.bin) is produced, you can do two things
with it.  The usual use is to feed it as input to the 1.1 version of mapconv
to fold it into the VirtualDub.vdi file, but you can also copy the ia32.bin
file to the VirtualDub directory as ia32.vdi.  VirtualDub looks for this
file on a crash and will use the disassembler table in it before using the
table in VirtualDub.vdi; this allows the table to be updated without having
to recompile the debug module.  You can also rename the .vdi file from a
newer version of VirtualDub to ia32.vdi to use it on an older version,
provided that the table format in the newer file is not incompatible.

VirtualDub has a special command-line option to test the disassembler:
    virtualdub /fsck

This will execute a rather strange instruction and manually trigger the
crash dialog.  Note that the disassembler in disasm.exe is slightly older
than the module in 1.4.10 -- the 1.4.10 disassembler fixes a couple of
cosmetic bugs (most notably symbol lookup syntax).  The table formats are
the same, however.

If you have any questions or comments, I'd like to hear them.  Let me know
if any instructions are missing or decoded incorrectly.
