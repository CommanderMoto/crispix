// Test file for Miryo's new Unlock system. 
// Songs/courses are matched by name, not folder name
//
// System modified by curewater
//
// The following methods are implemented:
//
// DP - Dance points, e.g. 2 per perfect, 1 per great, etc.
// AP - Arcade points, like MAX2 arcade
// SP - Song points, like MAX2 Home
// CS - Clear Stages, like 5th Home
// RO - Roulette, unlocked by landing on it in roulette.
//
// To be implemented: Toasty, Clear Extra Stages, Fail Extra Stages.
//
// Courses will be implemented eventually, but not yet.
// Songs are matched by title + subtitle.
//
// Any line not starting with #UNLOCK will be ignored.
//
// Sample lines:
//
// #UNLOCK:xenon:AP=10;
// Song xenon requires 10 arcade points to unlock.
// 
// #UNLOCK:the Legend of MAX:RO=3
// Song "the Legend of Max" is in roulette slot 3.
//
// #UNLOCK:PARANOIA SURVIVOR MAX:CS=30,RO=3;
// Song "Paranoia Surivvor MAX" is locked either by clearing
// 30 stages, or by landing on it in roulette slot 3.
//
// #UNLOCK:POP 4:CS=50;
// Course Pop 4 is locked until 50 stages are cleared.
// (Stepmania doesn't distinguish between song and course titles
// yet.
