Conditions
--------------

SongTitle:
enter the name of a song title. be aware -- if you have multiples of a song with the
same name then you may want to enter more information like the artist and even song
foot ratings.

Example-
SongTitle:Paranoia Survivor Max
this will show the BGA only if PSM is available.



SongArtist:
enter the name of an artist, any song which matches the artist name will display the bga.

Example-
SongArtist:Naoki
all songs where  the artist is Naoki will show the BGA



Clear:
clear will show the bga under one of four conditions:
* true - this will show if the song was cleared
* false - this will show if the song was failed
* fullcombo - this will show if the song was full comboed
* brokencombo - this will show if the song was cleared but not fullcomboed

Example-
Clear:fullcombo
this will only show if one of the players fullcomboed the song.



ModDisallow:
moddisallow will ensure that the bga is NOT displayed if any of the players
have the option. At the time of writing (11/feb/2004) not all mods have been
supported, but certainly things like little are not available (ideal if you
want somebody to get a rewarding bga for clearing a hard song in heavy, but dont
want them getting it via using a mod like little).
You may specify multiple mods by seperating them with commas (,)

Example-
ModDisallow:little,nojumps,noholds 
the bga will only show provided little, nojumps and noholds are not selected by any
player.



Grade:
grade will compare a players grade with their current grade if they have one
so you could have it display a BGA if a player AAA'd a track. You may seperate
grades via commas (,) which will indicate a grade history with the latest stage
being at the end of the list.

Example-
Grade:AAA,AAA,AAA
the above will show the bga only if the player has passed at least 3 stages and
one of the players got a AAA on each stage.




SongMonth:
the bga will only display if the current month matches. Months range from 0-11 with 
0 being janurary and 11 being december. 

Example-
SongMonth:2
the bga will only appear if its march.




SongDay:
the bga will only appear on a day in the month

Example-
SongDay:10
the bga only appears if it is the 10th day in the month.



Style:
the bga will only appear if the specified style is available. you can specify multiple
style by seperating them with commas (,)

Example-
Style:double,single
this will display the BGA only if the style is in double or single.




SongRating:
the bga will only show if one of the players is in a difficulty matching that specified
you may specify multiple ratings by seperating them with a comma (,)

Example-
SongRating:heavy,light
this will show the bga only if a player played heavy or light notes.



SongDifficulty:
if a player was playing a song with a footrating specified then the bg will display
you can seperate difficulties with commas (,) you can specify ranges like the following:
1-3 this is the same as writing 1,2,3 also you may check for ratings and greater for 
example: 9+ will check for all catastrophic songs.

Example-
SongDifficulty:SongDifficulty:1-3,5,9+
this will show the bga if the songs difficulty is 1,2,3,5,9(and onwards)


------------------
Overriding
------------------
If there are several bga's listed in a file, and the conditons specified are met
for more than one bga, the one listed nearest to the end of the file will have priority.

All conditions are mixable, for instance you may check if a song is in Expert AND if its
title is G2.
