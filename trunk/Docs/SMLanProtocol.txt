Protocol version not yet 1.  
  But 0x01 will be its version for inter-prtocol purposes.

This protocol is only intended to replace current protocol.  Because current protocol
not expanable

SMLAN PROTCOL TCP/8765

Protcol is entirelly packaged in EzSockets Data Packets (use send and receive packet)

This will prevent any out-of-sync errors with future or past versions.

The protocol is impervious to fragmented, or bonded TCP packets.

Basic Representation:
