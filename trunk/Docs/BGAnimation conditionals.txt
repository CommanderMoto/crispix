[this is an alternate, separate system from "ConditionalBGA"]

Conditionals allow enabling BGAs or portions of BGAs based on a boolean
expression.

*  Quick start

To only show a BGA on Wednesday:

[BGAnimation]
Condition=Weekday() == 3

[Layer1]
File=star
Command=x,100;y,200
...


To only between 10pm and 3am, use this Condition= line:
   Condition=Hour() > 22 or Hour() < 3

Only if there are at least 2 stages left:
   Condition=NumStagesLeft() >= 2

Don't show in demo or jukebox mode:
   Condition=not IsDemonstration()

Only show if the current song is "Happy Birthday":
   Condition=CurSong() == Song("Happy Birthday")

Only display the layer on even days:
   math.mod(DayOfMonth(), 2) == 0

Only display the layer on odd days:
   math.mod(DayOfMonth(), 2) == 0

Only display on April Fools:
   Condition=MonthOfYear() == 4 and DayOfMonth() == 1

Only display on the final stage:
   Condition=IsFinalStage()

Only if the "reverse" modifier is in use by player 1:
   Condition=UsingModifier(1, "reverse")

Only if the "reverse" modifier is in use by player 1 or 2:
   Condition=UsingModifier(1, "reverse") or UsingModifier(2, "reverse")

Only if either player got an AAA or better:
   GetBestGrade() <= Grade("AAA") 

* Advanced use

This can be applied to a single layer of a BGAnimation, by putting
the conditional in the appropriate [Layer] section.

[Layer1]
File=stage1
Condition=StageIndex() == 0

[Layer2]
File=stage2
Condition=StageIndex() == 1

[Layer3]
File=extra_stage
Condition=IsExtraStage()
