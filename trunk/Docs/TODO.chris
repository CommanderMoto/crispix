Is there a way to turn off the "keep bpm/gap change" screen, when AutoAdjust is turned on?

background videos out of sync at non-1 song rates

Hrm..  I had a few things about Stepmania I wanted to suggest, but can't think of all of them now..  Lemme list the ones I can remember:
 
 - In "all songs" don't have it automatically open one of the folders, or at least have it start at the very beginning of the folder
 
 - a "remember settings" feature or something, so when I press enter on "game mode" it automatically selects Single, Heavy, 2x, Dark, All Songs.  Or whatever you specify.
ddrllama: - When pressing "Escape" on the main menu of Stepmania, don't have it go into a demo..  Either have it do nothing, or an "Are you sure you want to quit?" or something message--I'm used to DWI, pressing Escape like 10 times until it quits, and I often forget to only press it twice and then to go to "Quit"

Add machine difficulty display on results

When you play Pump songs in DDR mode, sometimes it gives you three arrows in one line o_O

I'd also like to see "custom steps" implemented-- if you hit right twice on the arcade, you get to the custom (memcard) steps. I would like to see it so that any difficulty that isn't one of the standards gets put in this category (perhaps another way would be to put levels labeled "custom" there)

Only being able to see one difficulty at a time doesnt' work so well for a simulator as it does for the arcade, because things are so varied-- you have to end up doing a lot of searching to find what level you want to play. Some indication of how many feet the other options are would be nice.

1) The main menu should only be acessable by keyboard presses. Too many times people got in strange menus, quit the game, etc, without intending to.

2) pressing both starts at the same time should not reset the game. The most common way to start doubles or versus is for someone to go up to the machine and press both starts at the same time. Same for selecting difficulty. This caused a LOT of confusion.

a WIBNI (Wouldn't it be nice if...) is to add a "training" mode. basically, it would take a song, turn it into only having steps on 1 and 3. Similar to DDR USA. It was a real bear finidng songs for the newbies. (This is what prompted me to start lint-- there are many songs with only maniac steps out there!)

play intro.mp3 if available.

rename Notes to Pattern

You'll notice that if you add up the Perfects and Greats, they are far less than the max combo. Where did they go? Apparently Jumps count for 2 steps during normal game play, but ONLY for max combo. 

test BGChange grabbing from random movies

change banner loading on select music to cache banners for active section

change andy's link on the downloads page to say "para"

- Load banner/title graphics for songs in the current section.
> when you press Esc it validates the choice. For me, Esc would not save.
> Same thing for Esc starting the Demonstration mode. Start demo with 
- credits
- add marathon and long ver balloons

super shuffle doesn't correctly handle holds (Ayla Part 2)

There's a major Oni course bug (at least in Pump mode):

If you set a certain song to have modifiers, those modifiers will carry over to the next songs unless you change them. I don't think this was the original intention of how each #SONG line is supposed to work? Every time you finish a song, aren't the modifiers supposed to be reset for the next line unless that line sets it's own modifiers. This is a problem because, at least from what the README indicates, there's no normal setting for each modifier type (for e.g, no 1.0x to return to normal speed).

I'll abbreviate a course file I did:

#SONG:Pump\Artist1 - SongTitle1:EASY:0.5x,dizzy;
#SONG:Pump\Artist2 - SongTitle2:MEDIUM;

The problem is on song 2, it still gets the 0.5x and dizzy modifiers. Shouldn't they be reset for the 2nd song?

- After getting an "A" or less on Extra Stage 1, SM should display the total results screen for all 4 songs instead of cutting to credits. Clearing both extra stages should display all 5 stages on results screen. This could/should apply to if 5 arcade songs is selected in Machine Options. 

- Also, this may be more cosmetic but worth the shot. The ordering on final results is backwards, is it possible if you could display the songs FINAL, 2nd, 1st Stage, but in the reverse order? Like... SM has them being tiled wrong. Here's an example of what I mean right HERE (Taken from AaronInJapan.com) 

new sort orders:  1.) (Default) All songs layed out in respective groups
2.) Tabbed - All songs would be then "tabbed" under the folder name, as it currently is now.
3.) ABC - Alphabetical Order of Song Title
4.) Artist - Alphabetical Order of the Song Artist
5.) BPM - Beats Per Minute of Songs 
6.) BEST - Best records

Is the grading harsher in couples mode? I did well on the 2nd player side while I let the 1 player side stay idle. But I somehow got a C when I only had perfects and greats. (player 1 got a D). IF the grading is shared, should we both get C's? Otherwise, why is it so strict?

Animachanic suggestions:

Suggestions for SM to make it more MAX2-esque:

-The BPM numbers are of a more "squarish" font, and by default are very light gray in color.
-BPMs that change or go high are displayed in a light purple rather than red.
-When you select difficulty, the banners don't bounce/jiggle, they sort of scroll upwards.
-The sort select needs to be changed. MAX2 does it very quickly, nearly twice or three times
faster than 5th does. Also, the sound byte for it is different.
-I don't know if this is already being implemented, but it would be nice to make a "MAX2"
song selection, including songs from previous mixes, but being able to change their font
color on the song selection screen.
-When you change songs, the BPM numbers scroll upwards.
-On the evaluation screen, on the song banner, the icon for difficulty is displayed on the
left side at the top rather than the bottom.
-Also on the evaluation screen, the numbers start spinning much faster than they do in SM,
and they decelerate.
-You know how the grade letter "pulses"? The pulses need to be faster, about twice as fast,
and the amount of time they are "glowing" needs to be shortened to about half the amount
of time it is currently set to "glow".
-It would be nice if when you selected options, the little boxes to the side of the options
screen would display what you had selected.
-The "select difficulty" banners should be level with each other.
-I don't know if this is just lag on my system, but you should be able to scroll through the
songs faster when you hold down left or right.

AMENDS:

-Difficulty in feet should go up to ten.
-When changing songs, feet icons should not "bounce" when you switch songs rapidly.
-The CD titles should rotate a little faster, and should have a little more depth to them.
-1st stage text should be blue, 2nd stage text should be green, 3rd stage text should be 
yellow, and final/extra stage should be red.
-It would be more realistic if it didn't prompt you to hit enter a second time for options;
it should instruct you to hold enter in the readme. Just an idea.
-I'm currently in the process of setting up all the MAX2 (and MAX songs available on MAX2)
to play close to arcade-accurate previews. Once I finish I can send the files to you.

That's it for now.

Spig suggestions:
//////////////////////
If you're free of bugs heres what you can think of putting in or changing:

- Make SMANIAC songs show the Oni Banner instead of heavy

- Add a new color for SMANIAC like blue

- Support for oni specific gameplay frames

- Support for extra stage specific gameplay frames

- In the MAX2 skin, the max combo doesn't show

- Perhaps see what the groove radar looks like with a 1 pixel border, it may be a bit thick?

- Support for the results screen to show up to 5 stages cleared instead of 3

- (popular request) When choosing ALL MUSIC mode, do NOT start off by showing folder's. Instead, just leave all the songs out with each group being colored its specifc color. then, if the user wants by folder, all he/she has to do is sort to it by tapping UP-DOWN-UP-DOWN 

- Suport for ONI specifc gameplay frames

- Good/boo/missed jumps count only as 1

- Combo only goes up after getting PERFECTS

- Changing the metrics "StageY=" doesn't change the placement of the stage number.
http://spig.krystaljungle.com/STEPMANIA/oni.JPG
Perhaps we can have the stage number on the bar like that, and where it the STAGE is, it could say ONI. Just like the picture.

This doesn't quite qualify as a "bug," but--tiled scrolling background 
animations have very visible seams where the tiles meet; it'd look much much 
better if it was seamless.
